# Horiseon Digital Marketing and SEO Homework Project (Week 1)

## What is This Project?

This homework project is a mock-up website that required modifying HTML, CSS and adding accessibility features to both. 

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To apply semantic HTML and apply my knowledge so far about CSS by modifying a website to make it accessible to those who use screenviewers that may be handicapped, and easy to understand in the CSS code.
- **What's in It?**: The homework project included use of semantic HTML elements and alt tags to describe pictures, modifying the style.CSS to be more concise and easy to understand with comments, as well as a few other things like adding a title.
- **What Did I Learn?**: Completing this first week homework project helped me understand more about accessibility, the importance of semantic HTML, and using selectors and classes in CSS better.
